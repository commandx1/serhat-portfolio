With expertise in modern JavaScript libraries—especially React and Next.js—I excel at translating designs into pixelperfect, responsive interfaces. Whether it's Figma, Zeplin, or Photoshop, I ensure every detail is accurately implemented. On the backend, I prefer working with Node.js and MongoDB, building scalable APIs and real-time applications. Lately, I’ve been leveraging TypeScript to improve maintainability and type safety in my projects, ensuring robust and efficient codebases. Beyond coding, I enjoy optimizing workflows, structuring clean architectures, and continuously exploring new technologies to enhance development efficiency. Let’s connect and create something great together!"
